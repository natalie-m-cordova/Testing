# Security Policy

This repository is a sandbox for learning and testing GitHub features. While not a production project, we encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities you may discover.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported           |
| -------:|:--------------------:|
| main    | ✅ Always supported |

## Scope
- **In scope**: This repository and example code within it.
- **Out of scope**: Social engineering, physical attacks, spam, DDoS/volumetric testing, automated scanning that degrades service, third-party platforms we don’t control.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security vulnerability, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

## How to Report
Use **one** of the following:
- GitHub **Private Vulnerability Reporting** (if enabled) via the “Report a vulnerability” button, or
- Email: [Report an Incident](mailto:natalie.m.cordova-testing.report@gmail.com)
- **What to include**:  
  - Description of the issue  
  - Clear steps to reproduce  
  - Relevant logs or screenshots  
  - Affected commit/version
  - Impact of vulnerability
  - Suggested fix or migration(if known)  

Reports may be submitted anonymously or by a third party. If you need accommodations, you may request them at [Request an Accommodation](mailto:natalie.m.cordova-testing.accommodation@gmail.com).  

## Response & Disclosure
- **Acknowledge**: within **5 business days**.
- **Triage**: initial assessment within **10 business days** where feasible.
- **Fix & Advisory**: we’ll work with you on remediation and (if applicable) publish a GitHub Security Advisory.

## Responsible Disclosure
Please do not publicly disclose security issues until a fix or **up to 90 days** after acknowledgment, whichever comes first, unless we mutually agree otherwise. This helps protect the community while ensuring vulnerabilities are fixed efficiently.  

## Prohibited Testing
Do not exfiltrate data, degrade availability, or access accounts/data you don’t own. No destructive testing.

## Safe Harbor
We won’t pursue legal action or report to law enforcement for good-faith research that:
- Stays within scope and follows this policy,
- Avoids privacy violations/service disruption, and
- Gives us a reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure.

## Recognition
With your consent, we may **acknowledge** valid, novel reports in the project changelog/advisory. No monetary bounties are offered.
