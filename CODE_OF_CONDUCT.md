- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

- Offering help to newcomers and encouraging participation
- Giving credit for ideas and contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Disrupting discussions or intentionally derailing conversations
- Refusing to acknowledge or respect community guidelines
- Plagiarizing or misrepresenting the work of others
- Discriminating against others based on project roles or experience level

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (including issues, pull requests, and discussions) and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at [Report an Incident](mailto:natalie.m.cordova-testing.report@gmail.com). Please include a description of the incident, relevant dates, the names of those involved, and any supporting evidence (such as screenshots or links).  Reports may be made anonymously or by a third party.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Reports will be handled confidentially to protect the privacy of all parties involved. Only the project maintainer (Natalie Cordova / NMRCDova) will have access to report details. If you require accommodations to make a report, please let us know.

**You can expect an initial response within 5 business days.** The investigation process and resolution may take additional time, depending on the complexity of the case. If you disagree with the outcome, you may appeal by replying to the response email with your concerns.

Possible actions include, but are not limited to:
- Warning to the offender
- Temporary suspension from community spaces
- Permanent removal from the community

Actions will be proportional to the severity and context of the incident.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If you need assistance understanding this Code of Conduct or require accommodations to participate in the community, please contact the project maintainer at [Request an Accommodation](mailto:natalie.m.cordova-testing.accommodation@gmail.com). All requests will be handled confidentially.
